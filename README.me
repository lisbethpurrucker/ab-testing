**Displaying Variations Randomly:**
    - Utilize CSS to initially hide one of the variations randomly
    - Assign unique IDs to variations using data attributes for accurate tracking, requiring adherence to instructions by content editors
    - Limitations:
        - Brief visibility gap before JavaScript execution, though it's preferable to displaying both variations
        - Potential impact on SEO due to initial content hiding
        - Lack of server-side control over variation assignment, therefore uneven traffic distribution among variations

**Storage Selection Considerations:**
    - Choose between SessionStorage (within the current tab, survives refresh) and LocalStorage (survives browser restart)
    - Prefer LocalStorage over cookies to prevent sending web storage data with each server request
    - Limitations:
        - SessionStorage limitations in private browsing (cleared on tab closure)
        - Security considerations with localStorage

**Tracking Page Views and Click Events:**
    - Generate a unique UserId using a UUID tool, ensuring each tracking object is linked to a specific user for data filtering
    - Limit actions to a single count per user, maintaining accurate statistics

**General Limitations:**
    - CTR Calculation: Lack of backend restricts persistent data storage, limiting the implementation of Click-Through Rate (CTR) calculations
    - Testing: Incomplete testing coverage
    - Error Handling: Absence of comprehensive error catching as seen in validation of control variations
    - Variation Display Distribution: Uneven distribution of variation displays among users
    - Content Editor Guide: Requirement for a guide instructing content editors on proper content editing procedures
